# Vera C Implementation

Using https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/vera as a starting point and just playing
around trying to understand stuff and see what I can build on top of it.

I am clearly not a C developer and have no idea what I'm doing and also don't
really understand how [vera](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/vera.html) is supposed
to work yet, but here we are jumping off the deep end!

I've been looking for an excuse to play with
[cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan), so I'm using that as the
compiler!
